# We're glad you're here!

This is a style guide for writing :sparkles: training content for GitHub's [On Demand Training]({{ site.baseurl }}/). This guides makes some assumptions about you and what you're trying to do:

1. You've gone through at least one of the available training courses.
1. You want to contribute.
1. Your contribution is composed of training content. So you want to contribute words on the page, not necessarily the back end of how this all works.

Is that you? Let's get started!

# Keep it simple, silly :kiss:

You should strive to keep text on the page short and to the point. Why? Because people are easily distracted. No training page should require the user to scroll when viewing it on a standard desktop resolution.
